# Script name: kill-miner-nomail.sh
# Original Author: Andrew Fore, afore@web.com
# Purpose: To look for a miner process that is running in a compromised account.
#          The script finds the process and verifies that it is indeed suspect
#          kills the process and removes the files, as well as sending an email
#          to atlitops@web.com informing them of the action so that the account
#          can be suspended.
#
# Changelog
#
# Version 1.0
# - original version
# Version 1.0.1
# - adapted to check for multiple mining process under a single user
# Version 1.1
# - re-wrote script to handle multiple mining binary names instead of a single binary name
# - also takes into account the chance that a single user id could be running
#   multiple instances of different binary names
# Version 1.2
# - commented out all debug lines
# - added echo after e-mail to send UID back as result of the loop
# Version 1.3
# - added a new variable to hold the search pattern of binary names
# - updated the egrep calls to use the new search pattern variable
# Version 1.3.1
# - removed section that sends email message
# Version 1.4
# - added new variable to hold the bad urls used by the new attack vector
# - added new loop structure to handle new attack vector
# Version 1.4.1
# - fixed syntax error in code holding heuristic patterns
# - added differentiation in the exit statement replacing "no miner process found"

# Variable definitions
#
# user_id - string to hold the UID(s) of the suspect process(es)
# arr_user_id - string array to handle occurrence of multiple UIDs
# user_id_single - string variable to hold the current UID being processed
# miner_pid - string to hold the PID(s) of the suspect process(es)
# arr_miner_pid - string array to handle the occurrence of multiple PIDs
# miner_pid_single - string variable to hold the current PID being processed
# pid_binary_path - string to hold the absolute path of the executable tied to miner_pid_single
# pid_directory_path - string to hold the directory path containing the executable tied to miner_pid_single
# binary_names - string to hold the search pattern to use
# bad_sites - string to hold the domains known to be bad

# binary names to hunt for
# add additional binary names to this string as they are found
binary_names="(kernelupdates)|(kernelcfg)|(kernelorg)|(kernelupgrade)|(named)"
